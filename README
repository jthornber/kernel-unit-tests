This project builds several kernel modules that run unit tests when
they are insmodded into the kernel.  BEWARE: some of these tests make
assumptions about which block devices they can scribble over (/dev/sdb).

You should place a symbolic link in this directory to the md directory
of your linux source.

For example,

 LINUX_SRC=~/work/RedHat/linux-github
 ln -s $LINUX_SRC/drivers/md .

 # hack to allow multisnap-metadata-test access to dm_multisnap_metadata_* symbols:
 ln -s md/persistent-data .
 ln -s $LINUX_SRC/drivers/md/dm-multisnap-metadata.c .
 ln -s $LINUX_SRC/drivers/md/dm-multisnap-metadata.h .

Build with something like:

 make -C $LINUX_SRC SUBDIRS=$PWD
