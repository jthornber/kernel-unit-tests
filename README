This project builds several kernel modules that run unit tests when
they are insmodded into the kernel.  BEWARE: some of these tests make
assumptions about which block devices they can scribble over.

You should place a symbolic link in this directory to the md directory
of your linux source.

For example,

 ln -s ~/work/RedHat/linux-github/drivers/md md

Build with something like:

 make -C ~/work/RedHat/linux-github/ SUBDIRS=$PWD
